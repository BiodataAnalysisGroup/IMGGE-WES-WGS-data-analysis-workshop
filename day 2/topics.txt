1. Structure of larger variant calling â€“ CNV pipeline
	1. Discuss copy number mutations and theoretical background (describe their mechanism and the corresponding phenotype)
	2. Introduce CNVkit (pipeline, individual steps and required environment)
	3. Selection and highlight of selected genes
	4. Visualization of allele frequencies at the genome level
2. From variants to Genome Wide Association Studies
	1. PCA on SNP data
	2. Using PLINK to infer structure (including QC assessement)
	3. Association to phenotype
